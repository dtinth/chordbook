- Embeds YouTube video and synchronizes the video playing position with the current chord.
  Click on a chord block to seek the video to that chord.
- Automatic scrolling (useful when playing in a band).
- Supports transposing chords.
- Optimized for fast transcription using a data format based on [Nashville Number System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Number_System).
- Chord blocks are colorized based on bass/root note, relative to tonic (similar to [Hooktheory](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/about)’s color scheme).
- Supports songs with speed and key changes. [Example](https://dtinth-chordbook.netlify.com/r9s1-021.html)
