A chordsheet is generated:

== Previewing the chordsheet

You can double-click the HTML file to open the chordsheet in your web browser.
No web server is required.

=== Verifying if the chords are correct

When you hover a chord book while holding the kbd:[Alt] key, the chord will be played. Then use your ears to judge whether the chord is correct.

=== Reloading the chordsheet

You can *hot-reload* the chordsheet by pressing the kbd:[R] key. This has advantage over reloading the page because the song playback and the scrolling position is preserved.

[#directive]
== Directives

`title <Title>`::
Specifies the song title and artist. This will be shown as the page title.
`scale <Note>`::
Declares the scale to be used.
This affects the chords written after it.
It may be used multiple times in case the song contains key changes.
`youtube <Id>`::
Specifies the YouTube video ID.
A YouTube embed will appear at the top right corner of the screen, and the chords will be synchronized with the video.
`offset <Seconds>`::
Specifies the time from the start of the video, at which the the first chord begins.
`bpm <BPM>`::
Specifies the beats per minute.
It may be used multiple times in case the song contains tempo changes.

[#section]
== Section marker lines
Lines that have only one token that ends with a colon (`:`) denote a section.
They can be used to separate different sections of a song from each other.

.Example: A chorus section

Chorus:

[#lyric]
== Lyric lines

Lines that start with a semicolon (`;`) followed by a space are considered a lyrics line.
The lyrics text will be displayed on the screen.

[source]
.Example: A lyric line
----
; ฉัน— ฉันนั้นโชคดีเหลือเกิน
----

[#harmony]
== Harmony lines

A harmony line specifies a list of chords to be displayed.
Chords will appear as blocks.
In general, each block corresponds to the same unit of musical time (usually a quarter note or a half note, depending on the song’s complexity).
Each token in this line is separated by a space.

[source]
.Example: A harmony line
----
1/3 / 6m *3/4 / *5/4 b7 *1 / 4/6 /
----

The above example renders the following line:

.The harmony line when rendered
image::harmony-line.png[| C/E | - | Am | - | Bb | - | F/A | - |]

As you can see, there are 2 main types of tokens:

A xref:#chord-token[chord token]::
It will add a chord block to the harmony line. It looks like this: `1/3` or `b6maj7/b3`
A xref:#timing-token[timing token]::
It will adjust the duration of the following chord blocks. It starts with `*`, and it looks like this: `*3/4` or `*1`

[#chord-token]
=== Chord tokens

A chord token contains:

. A xref:#scale-degree[scale degree], such as `2`, `5`, `1`, `b7`.
. An optional chord quality, such as `maj`, `min`, `aug`, `dim`.
. Optional chord extensions, such as `7b5add11`
. An optional bass scale degree, such as `/#4`

==== Repeating chord

There is a special chord token `/` which means that the previous chord will be repeated. When rendered, it appears as a blank block with no text inside.

[#scale-degree]
==== Specifying scale degrees

For ease of transcribing, the chords are expressed in terms of *scale degrees*,
using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Number_System[Nashville Number System].
That is, instead of using an absolute note names, we use numbers representing the scale degree instead.

For example, in a song with the key of C major, these diatonic chords can be represented as scale degrees as follows:

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,1,1"]
.The C major scale and their scale degrees
|===
|C   | Dm   | Em   | F   | G   | Am   | Bdim

|`1` | `2m` | `3m` | `4` | `5` | `6m` | `7dim`
|===

Another example: in a song with the key of E major, these diatonic chords can be represented as scale degrees as follows:

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,1,1"]
.The E major scale and their scale degrees
|===
| E   | F#m  | G#m  | A   | B   | C#m  | D#dim

| `1` | `2m` | `3m` | `4` | `5` | `6m` | `7dim`
|===

You can see that we use the same symbol for each chord that has the same scale degree, regardless of the key it is in.

Accidentals can be added **before** the number.
That is, in a song with key of E major, the chord **Dmaj7** can written as `b7maj7`.

[#timing-token]
=== Timing tokens

A timing token starts with `*`, followed by a fractional number.
This will specify the size of the following chord blocks, up until the next timing token or the end of the line.
